  <h1>Learn HTML</h1>
  <h3>HTML Anatomy</h3>
    <p>HTML is composed of elements. These elements structure the webpage and define its content. <br>
      <'p'> Hello World! <'/p'> <br>
      As we can see, the paragraph element is made up of: <br>
      - An opening tag {<'p'>} <br>
      - The context ("Hello World!" text) <br>
      - A closing tag (<'/p'>) <br>
      There are many tags that we can use to organize and display text and other types of content, like images.
    </p>
  <br>

  <h3>The Body</h3>
    <p>Only the content inside the opening and closing body tags can be displayed on the screen. <br>
      Here's what opening and closing body tags look like: <br>
      <'body'> <br>
      <'/body'> <br>
      <br>
      Once the file has a body, many different types of content - including text, images, and buttons - can be added
      to the body.
    </p>
  <br>
  <h3>HTML structure</h3>
    <p>As you saw in the last exercise, we placed <'p'> tags within <'body'> tags. When an element is contained inside
      another element, it is considered the child of that element. <br>
        <'body'> <br>
          <'p'>This paragraph is a child of the body <'/p'> <br>
        <'/body'> <br>
      <br>
      In the example above, the <'p'> element is nested inside the <'body'> element. <br>
      Since there can be multiple levels of nesting, this analogy can be extended to grandchildren, great-grandchildren,
      and beyond. The relationship between elements and their ancestor and descendant elements is known as a hierarchy. <br>
      Another more complex example: <br>
        <'body'> <br>
          <'div'> <br>
           <'h1'>Sibling to p, but also grandchild of body <'/h1'> <br>
          <'p'>Sibling to h1 but also grandchild of body <'/p'> <br>
          <'/div'> <br>
        <'/body'> <br>
      <br>
      In this example, the <'body'> element is the parent of the <'div'> element. Both the <'h1'> and <'p'> elements are
      children of the <'div'> element. Because the <'h1'> and <'p'> elements are at the same level, they are considered
      siblings and are both grandchildren of the <'body'> element.
    </p>
  <br>
  <h3>Headings</h3>
    <p>Headings in HTML are similar to headings in other type of media. For example, in newspapers, large headings
  are typically used to capture a reader’s attention. The following is the list of heading elements available
  in HTML. They are ordered from largest to smallest in size. <br>
    * <'h1'> <br>
    * <'h2'> <br>
    ... <br>
    * <'h6'> <br>
    </p>
  <br>

  <h3>Divs</h3>
    <p><'div'> is short for "division" or a container that divides the page into sections. These sections are very useful
    for grouping elements in your HTML together. <br>
       <'body'> <br>
         <'div'> <br>
            <'h1'> Why use divs? <'/h1'> <br>
         <'p'> Great for grouping elements! <'/p'> <br>
         <'/div'> <br>
       <'/body'> <br>
       <br>
      <'div'>s don’t inherently have a visual representation, but they are very useful when we want to apply custom styles
      to our HTML elements. <'div'>s allow us to group HTML elements to apply the same styles for all HTML elements inside.
      We can also style the <'div'> element as a whole.
     </p>
  <br>

  <h3>Attributes</h3>
    <p>If we want to expand an element's tag, we can do so using an attribute. Attributes are content added to the opening
    tag of an element and can be used in several different ways. Attributes are made up of the following two parts: <br>
      * The Name of the Attribute <br>
      * The Value of the Attribute <br>
      <br>
    One commonly used attribute is the id. We can use the id attribute to specify different content, ids have several
    different purposes in HTML, but for now, we’ll focus on how they can help us identify content on our page. <br>
      <'div id="intro"> <br>
        <'h1>Introduction<'/h1'> <br>
      <'/div'> <br>
    </p>
  <br>

  <h3>Displaying text</h3>
    <p>If you want to display text in HTML, you can use a paragraph or span: <br>
      * Paragraphs (<'p'>) contain a block of plain text. <br>
      * <'span'> contains short pieces of text or other HTML. They are used to separate small pieces of content that are on
      the same line as other content. <br>
      <br>
      Take a look at each of these elements in action below: <br>
        <'div'> <br>
          <'h1'>Technology<'/h1'> <br>
        <'/div'> <br>
        <'div'> <br>
          <'p'><'span'>Self-driving cars<'/span'> are anticipated to replace up to 2 million jobs over the next two decades.<'/p'> <br>
        <'/div'> <br>
    </p>
