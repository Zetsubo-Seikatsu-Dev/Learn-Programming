Learn HTML
- HTML Anatomy
  HTML is composed of elements. These elements structure the webpage and define its content.
    <p> Hello World! </p>
  As we can see, the paragraph element is made up of:
    - An opening tag {<p>}
    - The context ("Hello World!" text)
    - A closing tag (</p>)
  There are many tags that we can use to organize and display text and other types of content, like images.

- The Body
  Only the content inside the opening and closing body tags can be displayed on the screen.
  Here's what opening and closing body tags look like:
    <body>

    </body>

  Once the file has a body, many different types of content - including text, images, and buttons - can be added
  to the body.

- HTML structure
  As you saw in the last exercise, we placed <p> tags within <body> tags. When an element is contained inside
  another element, it is considered the child of that element.
    <body>
      <p>This paragraph is a child of the body </p>
    </body>

  In the example above, the <p> element is nested inside the <body> element.
  Since there can be multiple levels of nesting, this analogy can be extended to grandchildren, great-grandchildren,
  and beyond. The relationship between elements and their ancestor and descendant elements is known as a hierarchy.
  Another more complex example:
    <body>
      <div>
        <h1>Sibling to p, but also grandchild of body </h1>
        <p>Sibling to h1 but also grandchild of body </p>
      </div>
    </body>

    In this example, the <body> element is the parent of the <div> element. Both the <h1> and <p> elements are
    children of the <div> element. Because the <h1> and <p> elements are at the same level, they are considered
    siblings and are both grandchildren of the <body> element.

- Headings
  Headings in HTML are similar to headings in other type of media. For example, in newspapers, large headings
  are typically used to capture a reader’s attention. The following is the list of heading elements available
  in HTML. They are ordered from largest to smallest in size.
    * <h1>
    * <h2>
    ...
    * <h6>

- Divs
  <div> is short for "division" or a container that divides the page into sections. These sections are very useful
  for grouping elements in your HTML together.
    <body>
      <div>
        <h1> Why use divs? </h1>
        <p> Great for grouping elements! </p>
      </div>
    </body>

  <div>s don’t inherently have a visual representation, but they are very useful when we want to apply custom styles
  to our HTML elements. <div>s allow us to group HTML elements to apply the same styles for all HTML elements inside.
  We can also style the <div> element as a whole.

- Attributes
  If we want to expand an element's tag
