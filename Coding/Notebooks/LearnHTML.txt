Learn HTML
- HTML Anatomy
  HTML is composed of elements. These elements structure the webpage and define its content.
    <p> Hello World! </p>
  As we can see, the paragraph element is made up of:
    - An opening tag {<p>}
    - The context ("Hello World!" text)
    - A closing tag (</p>)
  There are many tags that we can use to organize and display text and other types of content, like images.

- The Body
  Only the content inside the opening and closing body tags can be displayed on the screen.
  Here's what opening and closing body tags look like:
    <body>

    </body>

  Once the file has a body, many different types of content - including text, images, and buttons - can be added
  to the body.
