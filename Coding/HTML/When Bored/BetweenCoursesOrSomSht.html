        <br>
        <p>
            "<em>Now, what should I do here?</em> I'm not sure to be honest but I could try to do something." That's the origin of this HTML file, but that's besides the point.
            <br>
            <br>
            The point is: What should I make this Webpage about? You see, It's a little bit hard to make a Webpage while you should be in class looking at weird or sexual dances. So I've decided to make a Webpage about what my mind wants, that is, whatever my mind thinks at the moment...
        </p>
        <h4><em>For example...</em></h4>
        <p>Let's make a table!</p>
        <div id="Table lmao" style="text-align: center;">
            <table border="6" style="border-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">
                <tr><td colspan="2"><strong>Comparison</strong></td></tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>Minecraft</strong></td>
                    <td><strong>Garry's Mod</strong></td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Has an infinite world with infinite resources and posibilities</td>
                    <td>Default/Pre-Installed maps are pretty small</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>You need a Server IP to connect</td>
                    <td>Has Built-in Server Search</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Square Graphics</td>
                    <td>"Realistic" Graphics</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Usually you don't need to download data before connecting to a server</td>
                    <td>Servers Usually require you to download at least 1GB of data</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Family friendly environment</td>
                    <td>Contains Disturbing visuals like gore and monsters</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
        </div>
        <h4>Told ya</h4>
        <p>
            How does that look? 'Cause I honestly do not and can not care enough. Now, let's think...
            <br>...<br>...<br>...<br>Oh I know!<br>
            I could try to use images, although they'll have nothing to do with the rest of the code <em>(probably)</em>... Let's try it!
        </p>
        <br>
        <div id="Images" style="text-align: center;">
            <h4>Images</h4>
            <img src="">
        </div>
    </body>
